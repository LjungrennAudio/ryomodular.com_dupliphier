i guess there's nothing technically  worg with this - i mean i took it all the way to being ready for routing and getting it to factory, but...i just lost heart really. i just dont have it in me to make broingg bread n butter modules agaoin, it just plain suck sand it makes the company look so shit. i think this is liable to stay mothballed p much.
